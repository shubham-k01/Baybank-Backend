1.DO not create env file as .env.local , create it as .env
2. try catch blocks can be replaced by middlewares (done using asyncWrapper)
3. When we implement errors and middlewares to handle them, as we are throwing the errors explicitly , we need to use express-async-errors or implement try catch blocks
4. Custom defined middlewares and error handler middlewares should be placed at the last after all the routes and other middlewares have been mentioned in app.js
5. there are 3 ways of validating the data: 
--Mongoose validation
--Joi package
--Check in the controllers 
When we check in the controllers , we throw an error , so we use express-async-error or asyncWrapper
6. We want to check for the fields coming from  frontend in the controller if we have just implemented error handler for checking if error is instance of CustomEroor
